                    Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer,
                    entrepreneur,
                    writer,
                    political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed
                    format RSS[3]
                    and
                    the
                    Markdown publishing format,[4] the organization <a href="https://creativecommons.org/"
                        target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and the website framework web.py,[6] and
                    was a
                    co-founder of the social news site <a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.
                    He was given the title of co-founder by <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y
                        Combinator</a> owner Paul Graham after the formation of Not a Bug, Inc. (a merger
                    of Swartz's project Infogami and a company run by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the <a
                        href="http://boldprogressives.org/" target="_blank"> Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a>
                    in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at <a
                        href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/lab" target="_blank">Harvard
                        University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption</a>, directed by Lawrence
                    Lessig.[9][10] He founded the online
                    group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.

                    In 2011, Swartz was arrested by <a href="http://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Massachusetts
                        Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> police on state breaking-and-entering
                    charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and
                    setting it to download
                    academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT.
                    Federal
                    prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer
                    Fraud and Abuse
                    Act,[13] carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset
                    forfeiture,
                    restitution, and supervised release.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days
                after the
                prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he
                had hanged
                himself.[15][16]
                </p>
                <p>In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the <a
